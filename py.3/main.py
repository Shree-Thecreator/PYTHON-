ok = "Shreya"
print(ok[-4:-2])
# -4 means the total number in Shreya is 6 .so 6-4 = 2 .like that 6-2=4 so its going from 2 to 4 ,3rd and 4th means "re"


# String methods
a = "Shreya"
print(a.upper())
print(a.lower())
# upper() is used for block letters and lower is used for small letters
print(a.replace("Shreya", "Sonai"))
# like that you can use split,rstrip,count,center,find, startswith, swapcase title etc
print(a.capitalize())
